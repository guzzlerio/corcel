# Code-named-something

## What is it and what will it be?

This is a performance testing tool.  Some of the core aims of this project are:

 - Support many protocols
 - Cross platform (one simple statically compiled binary per platform)
 - Effective system resource utilization
 - Fast
 - Scalable
 - Consistent
 - Cater for all types of technical staff
 - Detailed and clear reporting
 - Support for Scenarios

## What tools already exist?

Some of the tools which exist today include:

 - HP Load Runner
 - Apache JMeter
 - Gattling
 - Apache AB
 - Siege

Each differ from the number of features, the number of supported protocols and other various things. 

## Why will this one be different?

I can't say yet but I am going to use the core aims at the top of this README and user feedback to keep me on track.
